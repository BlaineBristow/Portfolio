# Predicting NFL Prospect Draft Position Using NFL Combine Performance

## Introduction
The NFL Combine is run every year to get accurate measurements of the physical abilities of players hoping to get drafted. The goal of this research is to determine how heavily the Combine results factor into draft position.

## Methods
All players will be sorted into different dataframes based on position. Then, the correlations between each of the features and the draft position will be calculated to observe which of the drills and measurements are most likely to impact draft position. Further, a logistic regression can be performed to predict the round a player will be drafted in based on combine results.
