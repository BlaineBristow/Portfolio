# Predicting NFL Prospect Draft Position Using NFL Combine Performance

## Introduction
Every year, the best amateur football players attend the NFL Combine in hopes of being selected in the NFL Draft. The goal of this research is to determine if the measurable NFL Combine results can be used to predict the draft position of players, depending on position group.

## Methods
2 models were created for each of the 7 position groups, one to predict the round the player was selected in, and another to predict the overall pick of the player. The round predictor model was built on logistic regression, while the pick number model was built on linear regression.
