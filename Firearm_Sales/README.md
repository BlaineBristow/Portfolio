# Investigating Trends Between Public Interest in Firearms and Discussions of Legislation

## Introduction
Gun control is a widely debated topic in the United States, and every so often, a new law is introduced that would restrict the guns that the average citizen has access to. Due to the nature of the U.S. Government, there is a period between the introduction and passing of any bills where citizens would have the opportunity to purchase a gun that doesn’t meet the proposed restrictions in hopes of being grandfathered in. That leads to an interesting question: Are gun sales affected by the proposal of new gun control laws?

## Methods
Google Trends can be used to see what the public is searching for and gain some insight into their interest in purchasing a firearm. To best understand the issue, it can be broken down further into the following list of questions that will be researched further:

•	Are people more likely to buy a gun when gun control is in the news?

•	Do people attempt to stockpile ammunition prior to potential new gun laws?

•	Do people purchase additional accessories for their guns (sights, grips, etc.) before gun laws pass?

•	If there’s a proposed ban on rifles, do handguns become more popular than rifles?

•	Are people more likely to attempt to 3D print a gun in the event of a ban?
