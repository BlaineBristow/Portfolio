# Predicting NBA Playoff Teams Using Regular Season Statistics

## Introduction
The goal of this research is to find a way to use regular season stats to predict which teams are most likely to be successful in the NBA postseason by training a model on data from past seasons. A secondary use of this model could be to predict which teams are going to make the playoffs using statistics from part way through the season.

## Methods
The predictions generated by an accurate model could prove profitable in a couple ways; there’s a lot of money around the NBA. Team owners would like to know how best to spend their money to generate revenue. Winning teams get fans in seats. An advanced model could help the business make personnel and gameplan decisions to reach the metrics that it deems most important in a successful team. Sports bettors and oddsmakers could use a model that predicts which teams are the strongest contenders in the postseason to make more informed bets.

This model could be presented to either teams or sportsbooks. Teams will often spend large amounts of money on players that don’t translate to winning championships. If a model could tell a team what stats they need to achieve to win in the postseason, perhaps more informed decisions could be made when building a roster. In addition, sportsbooks could benefit from this model by being able to better set initial betting lines, potentially increasing profits.
