# Projects
A variety of projects completed in graduate studies showcasing ability to effectively implement data science knowledge.

## [College Bowl Games](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/College_Bowl_Games)
Model creation performed in Python. Merges and cleans multiple datasets before performing feature selection and logistic regression to predict which college football teams will win their bowl games based on how their offensive and defensive numbers compare to how previous year’s bowl teams have performed.

## [Firearm Laws](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/Firearm_Laws)
Exploratory analysis performed in R. Merges and cleans multiple datasets with the intention of creating a single data set that can be used to determine the impacts changes in firearm laws have on firearm purchases and fatalities in the years following.

## [Firearm Sales](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/Firearm_Sales)
Introductory research performed without major coding. Shows ability to seek out and perform cursory analysis on data by observing Google search trends on firearm laws and comparing spikes to the month to month firearm purchase data in the United States to see if there are any obviously observable spikes that occur at similar points.

## [Hotel Cancellations](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/Hotel_Cancellations)
Exploratory analysis performed in Python. Attempts to find trends in hotel reservation data to predict which reservations will be more likely to cancel.

## [MLB Salaries and Batting](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/MLB_Salaries_and_Batting)
Exploratory analysis performed in Python. Merges and cleans multiple datasets with the intention of observing trends between player salaries and player batting numbers for a single year in the MLB.

## [Music and Mental Health](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/Music_and_Mental_Health)
Model creation performed in Python. Cleans a single dataset before performing both linear and logistic regression to predict different variables indicating respondent mental health based on their music listening habits.

## [NBA Playoff Teams](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/NBA_Playoff_Teams)
Model creation performed in Python. Merges and cleans multiple datasets before performing logistic regression to predict which teams will make the NBA Playoffs based on how their offensive and defensive numbers compare to how previous year’s Playoff teams have performed in the regular season.

## [NFL Combine](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/NFL_Combine)
Model creation performed in Python. Cleans a single dataset before performing both linear and logistic regression to predict draft position of football players that took part in the NFL Combine based on their performance at the Combine.

## [Student Success](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/Student_Success)
Model creation performed in Python. Merges multiple datasets before performing feature selection and linear regression to predict how students will perform in their studies based on their responses to survey questions.

## [Weather Forecast](https://github.com/BlaineBristow/Portfolio/tree/main/Weather_Forecast)
Python code performed without any data analysis. Shows ability to code in Python by hitting an API to return a weather forecast based on inputs provided by the user.
